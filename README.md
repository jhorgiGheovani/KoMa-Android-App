# KoMa Android App
KoMa is basically an application that can help user to find healthy food recipes based on photos of ingredients that users take. This application is using machine learning to recognize the image ingredients that users take.<br /> <br />
KoMa consists of Two Words, Konco and Mangan, Which is an Javanese Word. Konco means Friend, it defines a person's relationship with the other. Mangan means eat, it defines a bioprocess of human life. So if we combine the two words together. Koma is everything about accompanying someone to eat and live healthy.
